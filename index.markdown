## CROKE — Characteristic mapping for Kinetic Equations
**Characteristic mapping for Kinetic Equations: from theory to simulations and Reduced Order methods (CROKE)** 
this page is in development

> Exploring characteristic mappings as a unifying language for plasma, rarefied gas, and turbulent transport models while keeping the computational footprint minimal through Reduced Order methods.
