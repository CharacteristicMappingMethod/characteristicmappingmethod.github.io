<h1>-Characteristic Mapping for Kinetic Equations-</h1>
<h2> From Theory to Simulations and Reduced Order Methods </h2>

</div> 

In this project, we introduce the characteristic mapping method to address the complexity of high-
dimensional kinetic equations, such as those involving ion-electron interactions in plasma fusion, by integrating mathematical modeling with high-performance computing. This semi-Lagrangian method achieves
exponential resolution in linear time, revealing ﬁne-scale details of the solutions and providing insights into
the filamentation structure of plasmas. By employing reduced-order models, we significantly lower the
numerical complexity of the computations. Our approach, which combines dimensionality reduction of
sub-maps with refinement through map compositions via the solution operator, is innovative and paves the
way for efficient evaluation of high-dimensional distribution functions across extended time intervals and
multi-scale spatial domains. This project is designed to test the potential to enhance existing semi-Lagrangian
techniques and advance our understanding of intricate local thermodynamic non-equilibrium phenomena in
plasmas, with applications in magnetically confined fusion.

## Positions Available:

### Master projects:

We are looking for talented and motivated master students in computational physics, applied mathematics or data-science.
The proposed Master projects can be carried out either as a 6-month internship or as part of a Master thesis.
These projects are funded, and we only accept Master students who are interested in pursuing a PhD afterwards.
The projects can take place within one of three teams: CEA Cadarache, LAGA–Paris, or I2M (Aix-Marseille University) in collaboration with McGill University.
